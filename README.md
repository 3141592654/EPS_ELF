Eastside Preparatory School ELF project

This is a project of Eastside Preparatory School, Kirkland, WA.

The software powers small LEGO MindStorms NXT robots with an Arduino module and attached laser gun and hit detector, 
enabling robot laser tag. Control is established through the decommisioned USFIRST FTC Samantha module and associated 
Field Control System.

This should allow FTC teams with old hardware to create a robot for a fun off-season game.

You are welcome to copy and modify this code in any way you like. You can also suggest changes, but please be aware
that I don't have a lot of time to respond to comments or pull requests, so keep your expectations low please.

Enjoy!
