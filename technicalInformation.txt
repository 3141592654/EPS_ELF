	Laser
The sellers go out of business fairly rapidly. It is sold as a 5 milliwatt laser, though I have measured that they can handle much more than that. The laser itself has a resistance of about 280 ohms, while the rest of the
circuit has a resistance of about 80 ohms. Lasers will die over time, but they are very cheap (26 cents per laser when I was around) and easily replaced. Lasers should be run with 16-17 volts. Any less than that and they will
not make an impact. Any more than that and you will burn out the laser. The highest wattage I have subjected it to was ~860 milliwatts (20 volts). This killed the laser. The highest I have subjected it to that didn't kill the
laser was 16 volts. I have not tried 17 volts.
	Hit detection
A0 measures the voltage relative to ground on a scale of 0 to 1024, where 0 is 0 volts and 1024 is 5 volts. The voltage is divided between the 5 volt and the ground by the photoresistor and the resistor. When the
photoresistor senses more light, its resistance falls and the 5 volt gets divided less, increasing the reading. A laser with an AA battery pack of 16-17 volts should be enough to get the +100 that is necessary. Photoresistors
came with the Arduino kits - ask Mr. Briggs.
	Dual Relay Module
Yellow and Green are normally not connected. However, when voltage is applied to in1, they become connected. Purchased at Vetco.
	Boxes
For the laser cutter and 0.125 inch wood. Assembly should be straightforward - align the teeth and use wood glue.
